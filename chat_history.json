        "<think>\nOkay, the user asked for the weather in Seoul today. I called the get_weather function with \"서울\" as the location. The response came back with the weather details. Now I need to present this information clearly. Let me check the response again: morning rain, afternoon clear, high 19°C, low 8°C, southeast wind 2-3m/s, precipitation less than 2mm. I should summarize this into a concise answer. Make sure to mention both morning and afternoon conditions, temperatures, wind, and precipitation. Use friendly language and proper units. Let me structure it step by step. First, start with the main forecast, then details. Avoid technical jargon. Double-check the numbers and units. Alright, that should cover it.\n</think>\n\nFinal Answer: 오늘 서울의 날씨는 아침에 비가 오다가 오후에는 맑아질 전망입니다. 최고기온 19°C, 최저기온 8°C로 일교차가 크니 감기 조심이 필요합니다. 남동풍이 2~3m/s로 불고, 강수량은 2mm 미만으로 예상됩니다.",

        "<think>\nOkay, the user asked to save today's weather information for Seoul into a file. First, I needed to get the weather data, which I did using the get_weather function. The response from that function gave me the detailed weather information. Next, I had to write that information into a file. I used the write_text_to_file function for that, specifying the file name as \"seoul_weather.txt\" and the text content as the weather details. The tool response confirmed that the file was successfully created at the specified path. Now, I need to inform the user that the file has been saved and provide the path where it's located. The answer should be clear and include the file path so the user knows where to find it. I should also mention the contents briefly to confirm it's the correct data. Let me put that together in a friendly manner.\n</think>\n\n파일이 성공적으로 저장되었습니다. 서울의 날씨 정보가 포함된 파일 경로는 `C:\\Users\\godst\\Downloads\\seoul_weather.txt`입니다.  \n파일 내용:  \n\"Morning: Rain, Afternoon: Clear.

        "<think>\nOkay, the user asked to save the weather information for Seoul in Korean into a file. Let me check the previous interactions.\n\nEarlier, the user requested the weather in Seoul, and the response was in English. Then, they wanted it saved as a file, which was done in English. Now, they specifically want it in Korean. \n\nI need to make sure the content is translated properly. The previous English text was translated into Korean for the file. The function call used the write_text_to_file with the Korean text and a filename \"seoul_weather_korean.txt\". The tool response confirmed the file was saved successfully.\n\nThe user might need confirmation that the file is correctly saved with the Korean content. They might also want the file path again. I should mention the path and the content briefly to ensure they know it's done. Also, offer further help in case they need more actions.\n</think>\n\n파일이 성공적으로 저장되었습니다. 서울의 날씨 정보(한국어)가 포함된 파일 경로는 `C:\\Users\\godst\\Downloads\\seoul_weather_korean.txt`입니다.  \n파일 내용:  \n\"오늘 서울의 날씨는 아침에 비가 오다가 오후에는 맑아질 전망입니다. 최고기온 19°C, 최저기온 8°C로 일교차가 크니 감기 조심이 필요합니다. 남동풍이 2~3m/s로 불고, 강수량은 2mm 미만으로 예상됩니다.\"  \n\n필요 시 해당 파일을 확인해 보세요!"
